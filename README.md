# EasyLoyalty

EasyLoyalty is a sistem that the user can use when they have more than one loyalty cards from different stores. 
Instead of carrying with them all the cards from each store, a better solution would be to have just one card,
that would store the loyalty points on servers, this issue is solved by the EasyLoyalty project.

The project simulates a few merchants that subscribe to our payment system(Pay&Score). The clients shop and their sites and 
before they finalize the orders they will insert their bank account information in our form.
